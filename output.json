In EEG, a patient wears a headset with electrodes that measures voltages at a number of points on the scalp.  These voltages arise from ionic currents within the brain.  A common *inverse problem* is to estimate the which parts of the brain caused the measured response.  Source localization is useful in understanding which parts of the brain are involved in certain tasks.  A key challenge in this inverse problem is that the number of unknowns (possible locations in the brain) is much larger than the number of measurements.  In this lab, we will use LASSO regression on a real EEG dataset to overcome this problem and determine the brain region that is active under an auditory stimulus.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"In addition to the concepts in the (prostate LASSO demo), you will learn to:\\n\",\n    \"* Represent responses of multi-channel time-series data, such as EEG, using linear models\\n\",\n    \"* Perform LASSO and Ridge regression\\n\",\n    \"* Select the regularization level via cross-validation\\n\",\n    \"* Visually compare the sparsity between the solutions\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"We first download standard packages.\"\n   ]\n  },\n  {\n   \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n   \"execution_count\": 1,\n   \"metadata\": {},\n   \"outputs\": [],\n   \"source\": [\n    \"import numpy as np\\n\",\n    \"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\",\n    \"import pickle\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet\\n\",\n    \"from sklearn.metrics import r2_score\\n\",\n    \"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\"\n   ]\n  },\n  {\n   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n   \"metadata\": {},\n   \"source\": [\n    \"## Load the Data\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"The data in this lab is taken from one of the sample datasets in the [MNE website](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html).

Young\n    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather\n    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been\n    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without\n    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would\n    not want to rewind it.\n\n(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to \"master\".\n    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not\n    build on top of it -- other people may already want to\n    change things related to the topic as patches against your\n    \"master\", so if you need further changes, it is better to\n    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the\n    tip of \"master\".\n\nLet's look at this example:\n\n\t\t   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"next\"\n\t\t  /       /           /           /\n\t\t /   a---a---b A     /           /\n\t\t/   /               /           /\n\t       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /\n\t      /   /   /             \\         /\n\t     /   /   /   b---b C     \\       /\n\t    /   /   /   /             \\     /\n    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"master\"\n\n\nA, B and C are topic branches.\n\n * A has one fix since it was merged up to \"next\".\n\n * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to \"master\" and \"next\",\n   and is ready to be deleted.\n\n * C has not merged to \"next\" at all.\n\nWe would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage\nB to be deleted.\n\nTo compute (1):\n\n\tgit rev-list ^master ^topic next\n\tgit rev-list ^master        next\n\n\tif these match, topic has not merged in next at all.\n\nTo compute (2):\n\n\tgit rev-list master..topic\n\n\tif this is empty, it is fully merged to \"master\".\n\nDOC_END\n",

This hook is to be used to override the default\n# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour\n# as a starting point for convenient modification.\n#\n# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current\n# branch is going to be updated:\ncommit=$1\n\n# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does\n# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).\ndie () {\n\techo >&2 \"$*\"\n\texit 1\n}\n\n# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the\n# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current\n# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.\n#\n# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD \"$1\"\n# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction\n# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is\n# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches\n# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do\n# not interfere with the difference between the branches.\n\n# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code\n# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in\n# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.\n#\n# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,\n# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on\n# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.\n# by adding \"cd ..\" or using relative paths.\n\nif ! git update-index -q --ignore-submodules --refresh\nthen\n\tdie \"Up-to-date check failed\"\nfi\n\nif ! git diff-files --quiet --ignore-submodules --\nthen\n\tdie \"Working directory has unstaged changes\"\nfi\n\n# This is a rough translation of:\n#\n#   head_has_history() ? \"HEAD\" : EMPTY_TREE_SHA1_HEX\nif git cat-file -e HEAD 2>/dev/null\nthen\n\thead=HEAD\nelse\n\thead=$(git hash-object -t tree --stdin </dev/null)\nfi\n\nif ! git diff-index --quiet --cached --ignore-submodules $head --\nthen\n\tdie \"Working directory has staged changes\"\nfi\n\nif ! git read-tree -u -m \"$commit\"\nthen\n\tdie \"Could not update working tree to new HEAD\"\nfi\n",
